        <p>In order to understand the foundation, you muster understand the FOUNDATION of our orginization. Here are the key aspects.</p>
        <p>SCP category is the foundations method of categorization. While these four are the most common, particular types of SCP's may require rare or circumstantial categorys.</p>
        <p><strong>SCP Category:</strong></p>
        <ul><strong>Safe:</strong> Anomalous object can be concealed and effectively entirely contained, even within a cardboard box.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Euclid:</strong> Anomalous object is either sentient, or needs a specialized containment procedure, or else risking a containment breach.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Keter:</strong> Anomalous object is either actively trying to escape, or its nature defies any traditional containment procedures.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Thaumiel:</strong> Anomalous object either contains itself, or can be used to contain other object. In this case, it IS the carboard box.</ul>
        <p><strong>Foundation Staff:</strong></p>
        <ul><strong>D-Class</strong> D-Class are used mainly as tools to be used for experimental purposes. They are a-typically death-row inmates. No access to information.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Maintenance Staff</strong> Used to build, maintain, and clean foundation sites and scenes. Access to information is extremely restricted. <br></br>Upon job complete are to be treated to class-A amnestitac memory treatment. </ul>
        <ul><strong>Mobile Task Force</strong> MTF are the hands and feet of the foundation, to keep containment breaches secure, protect researchers and investigate and collect potential SCP's out on the field. Limited acess to information.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Researcher</strong> Classed by a numeric system of 1 to 4, researchers find ways to effectievly contain and protect SCP's. Access to most safe information.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Administration</strong> The top level of the foundation, Site-Directions, Division leaders and more, decide and lead the foundation to its goal.</ul>
